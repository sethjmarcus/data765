The staff of the center would not want to devote resources for a program that does not meet the needs of students on campus; in such a case, something more helpful should be offered instead.

Indeed, it would be most unwise after turning on the hot water to neglect to check the water temperature before stepping into a shower. At a basic level, program evaluation is nothing more than applying this commonsense practice to settings in which organized efforts, called “programs,” are devoted to helping people who need education, medical treatment, job training, safe streets, welfare assistance, safety while traveling in airplanes, recreational services, or any of the thousands of services provided in a modern society. Program evaluation is a methodology to learn the depth and extent of need for a human service and whether the service is likely to be used, whether the service is sufficient to meet the unmet needs identified, and the degree to which the service is offered as planned and actually does help people in need at a reasonable cost without unacceptable side effects. Utilizing research methods and concepts from psychology, sociology, administration and policy sciences, economics, and education, program evaluators seek to contribute to the improvement of programs.\n",
