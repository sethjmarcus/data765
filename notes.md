What is program evaluation? A form of applied research. Retrospective research: we got money for this program, what was the impact. (prison family center). This was retrospective, but also protrospective (year 1 this was good/bad, what can be changed for years 2,3,...). Can be both quantitative or qualitative (or both) (DOE students credit accumulation in/out of a program. Quasi experimental with control group).

* To get an understanding of program evaluation, WKK first 4 chapters
* Elmhurst: don't worry about content of findings. Evaluation questions and methodology are the important parts. What are the way you are going to answer these questions (methodologies, see Data 734).
* Appendicies are important. Will see how they got from the questions to the answers.
