# Day 01 (01/26/2023)
* Based on cases (later on in the semester)
* Program evaluation as a practical things. Regarding the textbook: very little meta, more tachlis.
* Learn about effeceint reading.

**Hypothes.is**
* Social annotating system
* Use his copy so that everyone is on the same page
* Annotation is to know that you basically know what the hell we are doing. Will also provide fodder class.

**Grading**
* No major assignments
* Maybe some small assignments
* Present case analysis
* If there is a final project, will be a case study

What is program evaluation? A form of applied research. Retrospective research: we got money for this program, what was the impact. (prison family center). This was retrospective, but also protrospective (year 1 this was good/bad, what can be changed for years 2,3,...). Can be both quantitative or qualitative (or both) (DOE students credit accumulation in/out of a program. Quasi experimental with control group).

* To get an understanding of program evaluation, WKK first 4 chapters
* Elmhurst: don't worry about content of findings. Evaluation questions and methodology are the important parts. What are the way you are going to answer these questions (methodologies, see Data 734).
* Appendicies are important. Will see how they got from the questions to the answers.

History and background and posavac. Annotate on Hypothes.is

# Day 02 (02/02/2023)
Pro program evaluator: doesn't come in with a pre-conceived notion of what the outcomes should be.

* what are the needs
* stakeholders
* implementation fidelity (21 interactive sessions over the next year. Did we have 21? were they interactive? attendance rate? Why/why not?) 
* Outcomes, and how are they distributed
* Side effects
* does the idea make sense

# Day 03 (02/09/2023)

* Objective based evaluation: defined by objectives defined by sponsors of the program. Most approaches today are *Program Oriented Approaches*. 

* Not only did it work, but why. Program oriented approaches deals with the why as well as did it work.

Kirkpatrick Model: based on 4 levels of assessment:
1. Reaction: The extent to which participants find the training to be a positive experience - engaging and relevant to their work.
2. Learning: Did you actually learn anything?
	* Note the dependency of 1 and 2
3. What is now being done differently? (Behavior level)
	* This is the worst way to measure. The better way is to observe what is going on.
4. Long term outcomes
	* Now that you are all doing the behavior doing what you learned, has the organization advanced.
Big assumption with this model is that people will change their behavior based on knowledge. These are necessary but insufficient conditions.

activities: plan to do, outputs: did them.
not all programs will have all short, medium, and long term outcomes.

monitoring vs. evaluation: monitoring is much more, "did they do what they said they were going to" without worrying as much as results.

Series of if-then statements is a useful for understanding logic models.

Not only how many people completed, but who didn't complete.

Underlying assumption: why should the input work?
Can screw up 1 of 2 ways: screwed up the input, or the input is bullshit.
Example: checking drugs at drug festival (not going to hassle you)? Assumptions being made, but will it increase drug usage?

In practice, evaluators aren't bringing in sociology knowledge but rather working with enables/sponsors to think about why their intervention will bring about change.

Aspen chart: *really* good.

# Day 04 (02/16/2023)

Cases in General:
Idea is to be able to provide a synopsis/summary of the case. For our purposes, pull out what is relevant for the evaluators.

What looking at a study/data, *must* come up with alternative explanations for what is going on.

## Political Quotas India
Panchayat system: A form of local self government. 3 basic levels: local, block (community), and 1 larger one. What they usually do is manage local services (sort of like city services). Importantly, they take part in local development projects. 
Question that should have been asked: how do they get money for projects?
Post British rule, tried to get rid of caste from government. Further, wanted to decentralize more of the government (more local power). Then required a certain percentage of women in government.

**Natural Experiment** is what happened here (with the random rotations). You could look at any of the attributes that were improved with a survey.
Do we really have a natural experiment? Was there really randomness? We don't know how the assignment was done, perhaps the villages that were assigned were already more progressive. 
Additionally, India is modernizing (greater GDP as measured by individual purchasing power), so perhaps they are just a more modern country.
There is decent evidence that this quota system is working, but there isn't irrefutable evidence that it is working.
Maybe the quota system only came about because India is more modern.

Something that didn't happen was a change in national representation of women in government.

###  Logic Model

#### Resources
* Pre existing programs
* Relationship with schools, government, and NGOs

#### Activities
* Outreach
* Hiring and training (teachers)
* Cooks trained in hygiene and nutrition
* Medical referrals

#### Short Term Outcomes
* Improved nutrition
* Learned hygiene practices are practiced
* Improved hygiene in meal prep
* More children enrolled in pre-school
* Bilingual programs

#### Medium Term Outcomes
* Reductions in malnutrition
* Increase in 6th grade graduation
* Reductions in diseases related to hygiene

#### Outcomes
* Students are prevented from long-term effects of malnutrition on growth and development.
* Bolstering student’s their self-esteem.

#### Notes
* Assumption that a bilingual program will increase 6th grade graduation. In this case, students don’t necessarily know Spanish.
* Evaluate training via Kirkpatrick
* If the activities aren’t present/don't happen, have to understand why
* How to track 6th grade graduates: have to track them for 6 years, similar with reduction in diseases related to hygiene.
* How exactly do we measure medium term outcomes, and specifically, did our program cause these outcomes (or how much did it help)?
* Tl;dr: tracking long term goals requires institutional relationships and not always possible (think hygiene, hurricane)


### Stakeholders
* Parents, program leaders, program staff, local government, other NGOs, children, educational leaders.
* Have to look at ripple effects. Want to bring these people into the planning phase. Want them to  buy into the program and to utilize the program
