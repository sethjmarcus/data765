Program Evaluation
An Overview


To measure the success of the Sexual Assault Prevention Program, it is important to collect data before and after the program. This could include surveys of participants' knowledge of sexual assault before and after taking part in the program, feedback from participants on how useful they found the program, as well as any

 Program evaluation is a process of assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of a program, looking at its strengths and weaknesses to determine if it meets the needs of those it serves. It is important when evaluating a program that might reduce sexual assaults on campus to consider its effectiveness and limitations.

 Program evaluation is a process that uses research methods to assess a program's effectiveness and efficiency. It seeks to identify if there is a need for a service, if the service is appropriate and sufficient and if it is helping people in need without unacceptable side effects.


Program evaluation in organizational settings is more difficult than self-evaluations because it involves multiple people with shared responsibility for the program's effectiveness and results.

 Program objectives are usually harder to measure than those of a cook or painter, as they often take longer to realize. As a result, it is difficult to decide what criteria to use in evaluating whether a program is working well and how to respond when issues arise.

 Evaluating programs involves many different parties, and staff members can feel threatened by evaluators if they do not trust them as the evaluations could potentially harm their livelihood.

 Programs are usually funded by entities other than the people using them, such as insurance companies and government agencies. These funders often have more control over job security than the program users, meaning that the nurses and teachers must focus on keeping the funders satisfied instead of doing their best for the patients and students

 Program evaluation is difficult and includes assessing humans services such as education, medical care, welfare, rehabilitation and job training. It is different from other forms of evaluation as it focuses on discovering the value and worth of something.

EVALUATION AREAS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED
 Program evaluation is a much broader set of activities than just measuring the outcome of a program and that good evaluators consistently think about this wider range of elements. These elements include needs assessments, process evaluations, impact evaluations, cost/benefit analyses, formative evaluations, summative evaluations, and utilization-

Meeting Needs
 Program evaluations are conducted on existing programs, and while the original need that led to the program may not be raised as an important point of the evaluation, it is still important to assess the need for the program. This can be done by documenting what children do not yet know or the potential for crime or

 Evaluators consider unmet needs in order to develop programs, taking into account how the need might change over time and how it is perceived differently by various people.

Implementation


An implementation evaluation is an evaluation of a program to ensure that it has been implemented as planned, and that people in need are receiving the intended benefit. This type of evaluation focuses on confirming points like whether personnel have been hired, offices opened, and clients served, as opposed to an outcome evaluation

 Program evaluation includes the important function of monitoring, which is necessary to ensure that programs are running as planned. Without proper monitoring, programs can fail or not achieve their intended results.

Stakeholders
 Evaluators should take into account all stakeholders involved in a program, including those who provide the service, those who receive it, and those who are supportive or opposed. This has led to the term “stakeholders” as a general way to refer to them.

 Staff providing services are highly involved in the evaluation process and should be taken into consideration as stakeholders. This includes therapists, administrators, support staff, and the board overseeing general operations. There may also be others in the community who care about the program, such as family and friends of clients, people passionate about

 Evaluators must make reasonable efforts to learn about the major stakeholders and any important current issues. They must consider different expectations from administrators, board members, and therapists when conducting the evaluation in order to ensure progress and cooperation.

 Evaluation researchers have explored principles that support successful collaboration with stakeholders, such as clarifying motivation and understanding the benefits and liabilities of stakeholder involvement.
Side Effects
 Medicines, social and educational programs, and welfare policies can often have both positive and negative side effects. When implementing such programs, it is important to weigh the benefits against the potential costs, and be aware of the possibility of unforeseen positive or negative results.

Improvement Focus
 Improvement focus is an attitude or approach that evaluators take throughout the course of an evaluation to consider how a program can become better in the future. It is especially important for formative evaluations which look for ways to improve the program, and even with summative evaluations, an improvement focus will make an


 Evaluators should take an improvement focus when assessing a program, looking for its value and potential for further improvements. Even if a program has shortcomings or fails, its value can still be identified and used to inform better work in the future. It is rare for an evaluation to find nothing redeemable

Outcomes
 An evaluation of a program should consider the results such as how clients improve or other details about how those involved in the program have changed because of their participation. It is expected to lead to changes at the community level, lower incidence of particular diseases or other problems among the entire population, not just with identified

 Evaluations need to consider outcomes, and that the program is responsible for these outcomes. Evaluators will look into evidence of this, whether it be through the program's active ingredients or other factors, in order to determine if the program is effective.



When evaluating outcomes, it is important to consider specifics, compare aspects of the outcomes, and compare programs in terms of cost, value, and other constraints. These comparisons can help to determine if a program is worth continuing or if resources should be redirected elsewhere.
Nuances (Mechanisms)

In evaluations, there is a trend towards examining more complex questions such as the reasons why good outcomes occur and how different groups experience them. It is important to consider whether all services were necessary in producing the desired results, and if some people do not benefit from the treatment like the rest of the group


In order to examine mechanisms in an evaluation, specific measures of the suspected mechanisms must be included. This could include assessing how much each client successfully restructured their thoughts or a measure of the degree to which a planned intervention is followed. These measures can then be analyzed to determine if there is a
MISSION
 To help new evaluators remember the seven aspects of good evaluation—Meeting Needs, Implementation, Stakeholders, Side Effects, Improvement, Outcomes, and Nuances—the acronym MISSION can be used. This acronym is used in case studies throughout this text to illustrate the various forms these
COMMON TYPES OF PROGRAM EVALUATIONS

Program evaluation is used to meet specific goals, and can include studies of need, process, outcome, and efficiency.
Assess Needs of the Program Participants


Evaluating need is a necessary step for effective program planning. It involves measuring the unmet needs of an organization or community and considering various alternatives to meet those needs. Program evaluation is closely linked to program planning, as it helps identify which alternatives should be selected and implemented.

Evaluators assess need by examining the socioeconomic profile, social problems and existing services of a community. They also consult with residents and local leaders to determine which aspects of a program may be useful or unacceptable. In some cases, evaluators believe that self-determination and empowerment are essential needs
Examine the Process of Meeting the Needs
 Evaluations of process involve checking on the assumptions made while the program was being planned to make sure activities match the plans and needs match what was believed during planning. Outputs are monitored to ensure the program is operating as expected.
Measure the Outcomes and Impacts of a Program



Measuring a program's outcomes involves evaluating the condition of those who have received services, comparing their performance with those not receiving services, and determining whether receiving the program's services has caused a positive change.



Program managers hope their programs will cause positive behavioral changes in people, but it can be hard to pinpoint the exact causes. Evaluations must be conducted carefully to discover what is causing these changes, while also providing services. This can create tension between gathering information and providing services.

 Evaluators must take into account multiple views of the desired outcome when assessing a program, as different people may have different opinions on what constitutes a successful outcome.

 Assessing the maintenance of improvement from a drug rehabilitation program can be difficult as people may return to their same environment and succumb to peer pressure, making it hard to evaluate outcomes. Positive outcomes may be only temporary but can still have impacts on other people's behaviors and conditions in the long-term.

Integrate the Needs, Costs, and Outcomes


When evaluating a program, evaluators must consider the costs of the program in addition to its benefits. Cost-effectiveness analysis can be used to compare programs that are designed to achieve similar outcomes, but when different goals are involved, evaluation that incorporates multiple elements can be used to help administrators make

 Without measuring need, programs cannot be planned properly. Without a plan, implementation would be haphazard. Without effective implementation, outputs are not provided adequately and good outcomes cannot be expected. Without achieving good outcomes, there is no reason to worry about efficiency.

IMPORTANT ISSUES IN EVALUATIONS

Time Frames of Needs

Short Term Needs



Programs are set up to help people in crises, such as providing medical care and emotional/financial support. Educational services may also be available to help employees learn new skills. These programs should be accessible on short notice for maximum effectiveness.

Long-Term Needs
 Long-term services include education, psychotherapy, treatment for chronic illnesses, training for prison inmates, and rehabilitation for alcoholism and drug abuse.

Potential Needs


Preventive programs are implemented to avoid or delay potential problems. Evaluating their effectiveness is based on how many issues they prevent, which is different from evaluating programs designed to address existing issues.
Extensiveness of Programs


Program evaluations will use similar tools, but the decisions faced by local and national administrators will require different scales, focuses, and types of recommendations.

This text focuses on evaluations of small programs likely to be encountered by evaluators working for local government, educational and social service agencies. It discusses how implementation of a program at a local agency can differ from other localities, as characteristics of programs are not always easily specified. Organizations with support from
 
For studies done on a local level, statistical procedures don't have to be complicated because many administrators find statistics intimidating. Evaluators can help improve data summaries and presentations so that program information can be used to answer questions faced by program administrators.
PURPOSE OF PROGRAM EVALUATION
 The overall purpose of program evaluation activities is to contribute to the provision of quality services to people in need by providing feedback from program activities and outcomes. This feedback is necessary for programs to be carried out effectively and successfully.
 Program evaluation serves as a feedback loop to provide information to improve the program or make wise decisions between similar programs. It involves assessing needs, measuring implementation, evaluating achievement of goals and objectives, and comparing outcomes with costs relative to similar programs.


 Feedback can be used to either help form a program or assess its worth, depending on the purpose of the evaluation. Formative evaluations are designed to aid in program development, while summative evaluations assess the value and worth of a program.

 After a program has been evaluated using formative and summative evaluations to ensure it is effective, monitoring should be done frequently to maintain the quality of the program and identify potential problems. Monitoring can also serve a formative and/or summative purpose if needed.
 Evaluators may use their work to help deepen our understanding of programs and intervention strategies, but this text does not focus on such types of evaluations because they involve more ambitious undertakings than most evaluators deal with regularly.
THE ROLES OF EVALUATORS
Principles, Competencies, and Credentialing
 Program evaluations should be conducted using standards or principles, with competent evaluators who have appropriate credentials.
 The American Evaluation Association and the Canadian Evaluation Society have adopted guiding principles and standards that seek to ensure evaluators are providing the highest level of performance. These principles are more aspirational than precise, but still serve to guide evaluators in their work.

Proposals for establishing a list of competencies in the field of evaluation are more than a decade old, and current research on the topic suggest they fit well with principles and common practice. The Canadian Evaluation Society adopted a list of competencies, but the American Evaluation Association has not done so at
 The CES offers a credentialing process for members who meet the criteria. Additionally, there is ongoing discussion about the possibility of accrediting programs that train evaluators, and the trade-offs between quality and flexibility have not yet been resolved.

Comparison of Internal and External Evaluators


Evaluators can work for the organization itself (internal evaluator) or a research firm, university, or government agency (external evaluator). Evaluations done by an internal or external evaluator can have different implications depending on the affiliation of the evaluator.
Factors Related to Competence


Internal evaluators have an advantage over external evaluators since they have better access to program directors and administrators, as well as more knowledge about the actual operation of programs. This makes it easier for them to ask relevant questions during the evaluation process.

The technical expertise of an evaluator is important, and will vary depending on whether the evaluator is internal or external. Internal evaluators typically work with a small group of two or three people, while external evaluators may have access to more resources. Independent evaluators usually
 To avoid errors due to inexperience, organizations should select external evaluators with experience in the type of program being evaluated.
Personal Quauties


Evaluators should be competent, objective and fair, trusted by administrators, and have a concern for program improvement. They should also avoid any behavior that could suggest personal bias and thus damage their credibility.


Internal evaluators may find it difficult to remain objective when evaluating programs due to their dependence on the organization sponsoring the program. External evaluators are less likely to experience this, but internal evaluators should remember that their value to an organization depends on their work being credible and should focus

Factors Related to the Purpose oe an Evaluation
 Internal evaluators may have an advantage in performing formative and quality assurance evaluations, while external evaluators may be better suited for summative evaluations that could be seen as controversial. In these cases, it can be beneficial to use an external evaluator to make decisions that may not be popular
 Internal and external evaluators have complementary strengths and weaknesses, and a partnership between them can make use of the strengths of both.
Evaluation and Service
 

Program evaluators are responsible for bridging the gap between research scientists and practitioners, using the language and tools of the research scientist while taking into consideration the concerns and style of service delivery staff. They must also be able to communicate with organization administrators, who may have different priorities. This


The advantages of participating in a new field are the intellectual stimulation and satisfaction that comes from seeing research methods used to benefit people. The disadvantages include being viewed as intrusive and having to challenge program managers and staff with questions that must be backed up by data.

Conflict between an evaluator and an organization is inevitable. Early leaders in evaluation feared that such conflict would lead to invalid data, but now many suggest that staff members will use evaluation methods to improve programs. To minimize potential conflicts, evaluation systems should be developed to differentiate between information collected for program

Activities Often Confused with Program Evaluation
 Program evaluation is different from basic research, individual assessment, and compliance audits, and should not be confused with them.


Basic research focuses on theoretical questions, while program evaluation gathers information to help people improve their effectiveness and make decisions. Evaluators are interested in theories, but their primary purpose is to provide timely, relevant findings to managers. Cooperation can be lost if evaluators are seen as collecting information primarily
 
Human service staff members should not confuse program evaluation with the assessments made by educational psychologists, personnel workers, and counseling psychologists. Program evaluation does not involve diagnosing people, determining eligibility for benefits, or choosing who to hire or promote. Instead, it is used to assess how well programs are helping
 Program evaluators and program auditors have different methods and objectives for examining government-sponsored programs. Program evaluators are concerned with how the services have affected the children, while program auditors are mainly focused on whether or not the funds are being spent as Congress intended and if the program is in

Program auditors and evaluators have become more closely related in recent years, as evident by the name change of the GAO from "General Accounting Office" to "Government Accountability Office". Evaluators can help programs improve their services, but can be mistaken as program auditors looking to verify
Evaluation and Related Activities of Organizations
 Research, education and staff development, auditing, planning, and human resources are five functions that sometimes include evaluation.

Research
 Human service organizations may sponsor research with operating funds or grants. For example, a police department was awarded a grant to study the effects of providing emotional support to victims of crime. Researchers dealing with psychiatric problems and emotional issues related to medical care would serve as excellent colleagues for evaluators.
Education and State Development

Organizations have joined the functions of education and evaluation, with a long-standing precedent in educational psychology. Businesses have developed educational programs to train employees and universities have combined faculty development and program evaluation into one office, all needing monitoring for successful implementation.
Auditing

Some states have combined the functions of program evaluation and program oversight, which are typically carried out by state auditors. This coordination is similar to how inspector general offices in federal and state governments coordinate these efforts.
Pianning
 Evaluators with program evaluation skills can contribute to the task of planning by providing data, constructing surveys, and analyzing information to estimate community acceptance.

CASE STUDY 1
Open Arms

REACH Evaluation presented an evaluation report of the Open Arms Children’s Health Dental Service, a program supported by the Social Innovation Fund and in partnership with the University of Louisville School of Dentistry. The report is comprehensive and provides insight into the success of the program.
Meeting Needs
 The section "Documentation of Need" provided research to support the need for Open Arms, including evidence linking poor oral health to illness, chronic disease, and early mortality; research on the wide span of health needs among foster children; and data showing that Kentucky has the highest percentage of edentate persons
Implementation
 The issue of what was done in the program was addressed by providing copies of medical notes for dental visits, describing staffing strategies, and detailing how initial plans were adapted.
Stakeholders
 The evaluation report included perspectives of multiple stakeholders, including clients and their family members, as well as staff and students involved in the program.
Side Effects


The report on improving children's dental care found that having the services on site saved staff time in terms of transportation and scheduling. No negative side effects were noted.
Improvement Focus
 Suggestions from staff and clients were requested and listed, with an emphasis on how to continue the program past the initial period of outside funding.
Outcomes

The report presented direct counts of the relevant groups as primary outcomes, showing that 920 and 1,411 children were served over two 12-month periods. It also showed that 1,475 special needs individuals were served during the 21-month period. Statistical analyses showed a significant improvement in treatment acceptance,

SUMMARY AND PREVIEW
 Program evaluation is conducted to assess unmet needs, document implementation, consider various stakeholders, identify positive and negative side effects, measure outcomes, and learn why those outcomes happen. It helps agencies plan, refine, and assess programs, as well as make corrections in operations. Evaluators play an important role
 Chapter 2 discusses how to plan an evaluation, including addressing any fear and concerns that staff or sponsors may have before beginning the process.
STUDY QUESTIONS


Examples of activities related to program evaluation that can be found in newspapers or news magazines include medical care, education, and public policy. These articles may discuss the advocacy of new proposals or criticisms of current activities and provide information that could help inform debates around those topics.


The validity of such comments depends on the context and the individual program. Some programs may be more symbolic than effective, but some programs may have measurable impacts on social problems. It is important to analyze each program individually to determine whether it is a real effort or just a symbol.
 Program evaluation activities can be applied in an organization by collecting data on program performance, assessing the needs of stakeholders, and analyzing results to identify areas for improvement.

Program evaluation activities can be applied in any organization, regardless of size or type. In an organization with which I am familiar, program evaluation

Advantages: 
1. Improved accountability and effectiveness of programs.
2. Ability to identify successes and areas for improvement.
3. Increased efficiency of programs.
4. Opportunity to track outcomes and progress.

Disadvantages: 
1. Costly in terms


Different students may have different ideas on what outcomes to consider when evaluating the Sexual Assault Prevention Program. Reasons behind these differences may include personal experiences, differing opinions on the importance of certain topics, and different priorities when it comes to evaluating the program.
